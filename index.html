                            six cases including the alleged Cordelia drug bust case in which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son
                            Aryan Khan was arrested.

                            These cases were transferred from NCB Mumbai Zonal Unit director Sameer Wankhede to the SIT
                            Friday. Wankhede has been at the centre of a storm ever since Aryan Khan’s arrest on October 2,
                            followed by questions on the credentials of witnesses in the case and serious allegations
                            levelled against him by NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik. he is also a witness
                            and his selfie with Aryan Khan in
                            custody did the rounds of social media — demanded money on behalf of Wankhede. The six cases
                            handed over to the SIT comprise the Aryan Khan case, a narcotics case against
                            Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan, another against actor Armaan Kohli, and drug busts in Mumbra,
                            Jogeshwari and Dongri areas of Mumbai.</p>

                            These cases have been taken over by the Delhi unit since there are international ramifications.
                            Wherever doubts have been cast or allegations of corruption have been made, such cases may be
                            relooked,” an NCB officer said.

                            Corruption allegations have been levelled against Wankhede in the Aryan Khan case and the NCB is
                            also conducting a vigilance inquiry against him and his team. Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the

                        <p>Actor Amitabh Bachchan has sent a legal notice to a pan masala brand that has continued to air TV
                            commercials featuring him despite termination of contract. He had announced his withdrawal from
                            the Kamla Pasand campaign in October after a national anti-tobacco organisation requested him to
                            refrain from endorsing a pan masala brand to help prevent youngsters from getting addicted to
                            tobacco. Bachchan was also trolled on social media for the campaign.

                            “Came to know from the office of Mr Bachchan, that Legal notice has been sent to Kamala Pasand,
                            to stop Broadcasting the TV commercials with Mr Bachchan immediately.. as it was noticed that
                            despite termination of the Endorsement agreement ‘ Kamala Pasand ‘ has ignored the same and is
                            seen to continue Airing the TV Commercials,” a source close to the actor confirmed.</p>

                        <p>Bachchan had announced his withdrawal from the advertising campaign on his 79th birthday, saying
                            that he wasn’t aware that it came under surrogate advertisement. Surrogate advertising is
                            defined as a form of advertising which is used to promote banned products, like
                            cigarettes\tobacco and alcohol, in the disguise of another product.A statement from the actor’s
                            office had read at the time, “Kamala Pasand … a few days after the commercial was aired, Mr
                            Bachchan contacted the brand and stepped out of it last week . Upon checking why this sudden
                            move – it was revealed that when Mr Bachchan became associated with the brand , he wasn’t aware
                            that it falls under surrogate advertising. Mr Bachchan has terminated the contract with the
                            Brand, has written to them his termination and has returned the money received for the
                            promotion.”</p>
